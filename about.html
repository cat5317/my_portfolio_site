      <h2>about</h2>

      <p>My unconventional journey began upon my graduation from Truman State
        University where I recieved my degree in Agricultural Science. Three
        years later, the company I was working for declared bankruptcy and closed.
        I took this as an opportunity to reflect on and re-evaluate my career
        options. I have aways loved designing and creating. As the ever inqusitive
        student, I returned to school to obtain a degree in Graphic Communications.</p>

      <p>This lead me to my first encounter with web design. I had a great
        teacher, who helped instill a sense of wonder and excitement about the web;
        the limitless possibilities, the accessability, the wealth of information.
        I took the two available web design classes my program had to offer. </p>

      <p> Through social media and friends I learned about LaunchCode and the
      CoderGirl program. I joined a diverse group of women for the Winter 2019
      CodeGirl cohort in the Web Development track. </p>
